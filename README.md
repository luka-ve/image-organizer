# image-organizer

image-organizer aims to be an organiziation tool for images of all kinds. In the future it will allow tagging of pictures, batch conversion, and organization into folder. This is a learning project for me to get to know databases, GUIs, and image manipulation.

## Proposed features

* Database
  * Store locations to images
  * Manage immage tags
* GUI
  * Display folders
  * Add images
  * Edit tags
